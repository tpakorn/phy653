    "## Guiding Center Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding center approximation is a simplification used in plasma physics to simplify the analysis of charged particle motion in a magnetic field. It is particularly useful when the gyration (circular motion) of particles around magnetic field lines is much faster than their drift motion. The key idea is to treat the particle as if it moves along a \"guiding center\" trajectory, which represents the average motion of the particle over many gyration periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the guiding center approximation, the four drift velocities mentioned earlier can be calculated using various mathematical techniques, including averaging over the gyration motion. This approximation allows researchers to describe the particle's motion more conveniently, making it easier to analyze and predict the behavior of particles in complex magnetic field configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the guiding center approximation and considering the four drift velocities, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of charged particles in plasmas and magnetic confinement devices, ultimately advancing our understanding of fusion energy research and other plasma-related phenomena.\n",

    "Drift theory is a framework used in plasma physics to describe the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. It helps us understand how these particles move in addition to their gyration (circular motion) around magnetic field lines. Drift theory is particularly useful when analyzing the behavior of charged particles in a tokamak, a type of device used for controlled nuclear fusion research, or in other plasma confinement systems.\n",
