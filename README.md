# PHY653: Computational Electromagnetics and Plasma Physics

- Semester: 2024/1
- Instructor: Pakorn Wongwaitayakornkul, PhD.
- Location: Computer Room LC4, Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus

## Course Description:
This course offers an exploration of computational methods used in studying electromagnetism and plasma physics, focusing on solving differential equations, simulating electromagnetic field interactions with charged particles, and investigating wave-particle interactions. Students will gain hands-on experience through computational labs using Jupyter Python notebooks to implement and solve problems related to the topics discussed in lectures. The course schedule is as follows:
